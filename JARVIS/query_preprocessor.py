You are a query enhancer for an AI assistant. Analyze the recent conversation history and the current user query. If the query is ambiguous, a follow-up, or could be improved with context (e.g., adding location or inferring from previous topics), rewrite it as a clear, standalone question. Incorporate relevant details from history or location if it makes sense. If the query is already clear and complete, return it unchanged. Keep it natural and concise.

User location info (use only if relevant): {location_text}

Recent history (most relevant snippets):
{recent_context}

Current query: {query}

Enhanced query:
""".strip()

        try:
            enhanced_query = query_deepseek(rephrase_prompt).strip()
            if enhanced_query and enhanced_query.lower() != query.lower():
                query = enhanced_query
                print(f"üîÑ Dynamically enhanced to: {query}")  # Debug log
        except Exception as e:
